<p>Emil is Ari's husband. Ari loves him a lot and the first day she played idv, the moment she saw him in the character archive she knew he was her main. She was right, and she never played anyone else. </p>
<p>Emil is a container/rescuer in idv. His special ability is his grappling hook. Per game, he is allowed 3 hooks. He can latch onto walls and either perform a jump off of them, or can climb over them. He's good for getting distance from the hunter and for transitioning kiting areas. He has an ability called "Bonded" where when he's within the radius of a "Psychologist" player, the two can run to each other. This is also good for getting distance from the hunter. His other ability, called "Emotional Attachment", greatly increases his interaction speed when rescuing the Psychologist from a Rocket Chair. However, when Emil decodes with other female characters who aren't Psychologist, his decoding speed decreases by 30%.

<p>Patient currently has 19 skins available. 2 S-tiers, 5 A-tiers, 7 B-tiers, and 5 C-tiers. Ari's personal favorite is Luminary. Her evil ex bought it for her so she didn't have to spend the $30 getting it. He has matching skins with the Psychologist and I need a duo to play her so we can match luminary x everlasting night... </p>
<p>He has a new skinline coming out and it makes my heart want to burst into two I'm so excited for it I need my job to respond to me so i can buy it.</p>
